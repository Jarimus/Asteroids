# Asteroids

## Description

A simple guided pygame-project for a course on [Boot.Dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python): make the Asteroids game using pygame.

## Additional features

I have added features beyong the initial scope of the guided project. Extra features in no specific order:

- 2-player mode
- Player collision
- Acceleration instead of a constant speed for players
- Gun recharge indicator
- Gun recoil
- Shotgun instead of the basic one-shot gun
- Main menu
- Score
- Two firing modes: single shot and shotgun

## Future features

Here are some features I would like to implement in the future.

- Increasing difficult: the higher the score, the more difficult the game gets.
- Different enemy types
- Health
- Highscores stored in a file
